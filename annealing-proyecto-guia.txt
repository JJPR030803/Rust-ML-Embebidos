### Conceptual Overview

1. **State**: The temperature setting
2. **Energy function**: A combination of cost and dissatisfaction
3. **Temperature parameter**: Controls how likely you are to accept worse solutions

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Define your objective function**:
   - Cost component: 10 pesos per degree change
   - Satisfaction component: How far the temperature is from what the user wants
   - Combined function: `total_cost = change_cost + dissatisfaction_penalty`

2. **Initialize the algorithm**:
   - Start with the current temperature (e.g., 25.0)
   - Set an initial "temperature" parameter for the algorithm (unrelated to actual temperature)

3. **Iterative process**:
   - Generate a neighbor solution (small random change to current temperature)
   - Calculate the cost difference between current and neighbor solutions
   - Accept better solutions always
   - Accept worse solutions with a probability based on how much worse they are and the current "temperature" parameter
   - Gradually decrease the "temperature" parameter (cooling schedule)

4. **Example for your specific case**:
   - Starting at 25.0, user wants 22.0
   - Each iteration might try temperatures like 24.8, 24.5, etc.
   - As the algorithm progresses, it becomes less likely to accept temperatures that move away from the optimal solution

### Balancing Factors

For your specific problem:
- The cost of change (10 pesos per degree) creates pressure to minimize change
- The user preference (22.0 today) creates pressure to change despite the cost
- The algorithm will find a balance that minimizes total dissatisfaction + cost

### Implementation Considerations

- You'll need to weight the satisfaction component appropriately
- The cooling schedule (how quickly you reduce the "temperature" parameter) affects how thoroughly the algorithm explores the solution space
- Multiple runs with different starting points might help ensure you find the global optimum

This approach can easily extend to multiple variables (temperature, humidity, etc.) by making your state a vector and adjusting your energy function accordingly.
